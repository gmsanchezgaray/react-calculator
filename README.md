## ğŸ§® Calculator App

>Calculator with a pokedex style, built with [React](https://es.reactjs.org). I use the Hooks API for practice, such as: useState, useEffect and useContext. 

## ğŸš€ Demo 

>Here is a working live [Demo](https://gmsanchezgaray.github.io/react-calculator/). 

## ğŸ’» Set up
```
git clone https://github.com/gmsanchezgaray/react-calculator.git 
cd react-calculator
npm start
```

## ğŸ“‘ About the App

#### ğŸŸ§ Challenge 
ğŸ”¸ User can click a '+/-' button to change the sign of the number that is currently displayed.\
ğŸ”¸ The Calculator doesn't use the `eval()` function to execute calculations 

#### ğŸŸ¦ User Stories

ğŸ”¹ User can see a display showing the current number entered or the result of the last operation.\
ğŸ”¹ User can see an entry pad containing buttons for the digits 0-9, operations '+', '-', '*', '/', and '=', a '<' button (for delete the last number), and an 'C' button (for clear all).\
ğŸ”¹ User can enter numbers as sequences up to 8 digits long by clicking on digits in the entry pad. Entry of any digits more than 8 will be ignored.\
ğŸ”¹ User can see 'ERR' displayed if any operation would exceed the 8 digit maximum.\
ğŸ”¹ The user can click the 'C' button to erase the last number or undo a mistake.
